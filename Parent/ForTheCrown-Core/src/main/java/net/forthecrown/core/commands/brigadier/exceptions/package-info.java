package net.forthecrown.core.commands.brigadier.exceptions;
/*
 * Contains the exceptions thrown by Brigadier commands
 * Mostly you can just use the CrownCommandException for things
 *
 * It only requires a message, and unless you set a color, it will be red
 * You can also pass in two extra arguments, the command's input as a string and
 * int value of cursor, basically it means where the string reader was at with the string reading
