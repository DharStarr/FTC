Current TODO:

- GC rank toggle, for each individual rank :sad:

Bugs:
- isClearAbove in Util may be potentially wrong.

- Waypoint validation marks snow as an interfering
  block

- Bounds3i usages are still buggy, especially
  the AreaTrigger case

- AreaTriggers tend to have malformed bounding
  boxes or broken collision code

-





Finished:
- Add color unlocking menu for guilds
- /shop item challenges
- Fix /msg preview
- #./# in /challenges
- /rocket <entity> add <vector>
- Hide waypoint logic from player

- Missing/broken guild upgrades:
    - Max Chunks
    - Max Members
    - Guild chest size

- Different formats for colors:
    - different borders
    - use 2 colors as gradient
    - name in italic
