TODO:
X   1. In RaidGenerator: make sure world files are copied from example world to actual raid world.
    2. Create loot tables for LootData to use
    3. Create a /vraid command for creating and editing viking raids.
    4. Once the previous items have been confirmed to work begin implementation of the following items:
        I. MobData, a RaidData class with info for spawning mobs with nbt and location.
        II. The most likely massive Trigger system, try to use as much of NMS's CriterionTrigger system as possible,
            aka the the Advancement trigger system lmao.
        III. Make sure shit serializes good :)

Throughout all of these steps, try to implement iterative design or testing or whatever it's called as much as possible.
Make thing then: test -> improve -> repeat until thing is perfect.
